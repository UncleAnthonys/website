        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 24 February 2026</p>

        <p>Little Fort Studios ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Little Lines mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App. This policy applies to users worldwide and includes jurisdiction-specific provisions where required by local law.</p>

        <h2>1. About the App</h2>
        <p>Little Lines is a creative tool that allows parents and guardians to generate personalised colouring pages and storybooks for children. The App is designed to be operated by adults (parents/guardians), not directly by children.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Photos you upload to generate colouring pages</li>
            <li>Your child&rsquo;s age (used only to adjust content difficulty)</li>
            <li>Account information if you create an account (email address)</li>
            <li>Subscription and payment information (processed by Apple/Google, not stored by us)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic device information (device type, operating system version)</li>
            <li>App usage data (features used, crash reports)</li>
            <li>We do NOT collect location data, contacts, or browsing history</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photo Processing:</strong> Photos you upload are sent to our secure servers for AI processing to generate colouring pages. Photos are processed and automatically deleted from our servers within 24 hours. We do not retain, sell, or share your photos.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Your child&rsquo;s age is used solely to adjust the difficulty and complexity of generated content. This data is not stored permanently.</li>
            <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> Anonymous usage data helps us improve the App&rsquo;s performance and features.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Your email address is used to respond to support enquiries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Photo Data and AI Processing</h2>
        <p>We take special care with photos given our App&rsquo;s focus on content for children:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photos are transmitted using encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
            <li>Photos are processed by our AI systems and deleted within 24 hours</li>
            <li>We do NOT use facial recognition or biometric identification</li>
            <li>We do NOT use your photos to train AI models</li>
            <li>We do NOT share photos with third parties</li>
            <li>Generated colouring pages are stored in your account for your access only</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Little Lines is designed for use by parents and guardians. The App is not intended to be operated directly by children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@littlefortstudios.com">support@littlefortstudios.com</a> and we will promptly delete such information.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is stored on secure servers with industry-standard encryption</li>
            <li>We use Firebase (Google Cloud) for data storage, which is certified under ISO 27001, SOC 1/2/3, and other security standards</li>
            <li>We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your data</li>
            <li>Despite our best efforts, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Deleted within 24 hours of processing</li>
            <li><strong>Generated Content:</strong> Retained in your account until you delete it or close your account</li>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Retained until you request deletion</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Retained in anonymised form for up to 12 months</li>
        </ul>
